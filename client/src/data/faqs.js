      question: "How does the adoption process work?",
      answer: "Our adoption process starts with browsing available pets on our website. Once you find a pet you're interested in, you can submit an adoption application. Our team will review your application and conduct a brief interview. If approved, you'll schedule a meet-and-greet with your potential new pet before finalizing the adoption."

      question: "What are the adoption fees?",
      answer: "Adoption fees typically range from $150 to $300 depending on the animal's age, breed, and medical history. These fees help cover the costs of vaccinations, spaying/neutering, microchipping, and general care while the pet is with us. All adoption fees are reinvested into our shelter to help more animals."

      question: "Are the pets vaccinated and spayed/neutered?",
      answer: "Yes, all our adoptable pets are up-to-date on vaccinations, and most are already spayed or neutered. In cases where an animal hasn't yet been altered due to age or medical reasons, we'll provide information about our low-cost spay/neuter services."

      question: "Can I adopt if I live in an apartment?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Many of our pets do well in apartments. We'll work with you to find a pet that matches your living situation. Some landlords may require pet deposits or have restrictions, so we recommend checking your lease before applying."

      question: "What if the adoption doesn't work out?",
      answer: "We understand that sometimes, despite best intentions, an adoption may not work out. We have a 14-day trial period during which you can return the pet if there are issues that cannot be resolved. We're committed to finding the right match for both pets and adopters."

      question: "How can I volunteer or foster?",
      answer: "We welcome volunteers and foster families! To volunteer, visit our Volunteer page and fill out an application. For fostering, we provide all necessary supplies and medical care for the pet while they stay in your home temporarily. Both options are crucial to our mission and help save more lives."
